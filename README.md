Project Title: Notes Making Web Application

Project Description:

I developed a Notes Making Web Application, a user-friendly platform that allows users to create, manage, and organize their notes online. This project showcases my proficiency in a variety of web development technologies and tools, including HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, EJS, Node.js, MongoDB, and Express.js.

Key Features:

User Authentication: Implemented user registration and login functionality to ensure secure access to personal notes.

Note Creation: Users can create, edit, and delete notes, providing a seamless and intuitive note-taking experience.

Categories and Tags: The app allows users to categorize and tag their notes for easy organization and retrieval.

Technologies Used:

HTML/CSS/Bootstrap: Developed the frontend of the application with these technologies to create a responsive and visually appealing design.

EJS: Used EJS templates for server-side rendering, allowing dynamic content generation.

Node.js: Built the backend of the application using Node.js for server-side logic and routing.

Express.js: Routes for handling user requests and data manipulation.

MongoDB: Implemented a NoSQL database to store user information and note data.
